# Student Grade Manager

# Step 1: Get student scores
student_scores = input("Enter student scores separated by commas:(_/100) ")
scores = [int(score) for score in student_scores.split(",")]

# Step 2: Assign Grades using List Comprehension
grades = [
    "A" if score >= 90 else
    "B" if score >= 80 else
    "C" if score >= 70 else
    "D" if score >= 60 else
    "F"
    for score in scores
]

# Step 3: Filter Passing and Failing Students
passing_students = [score for score in scores if score >=60]
failing_students = [score for score in scores if score < 60]

# Step 4: Print Results
print("\n--- Student Grades ----")
for i, (score, grade) in enumerate(zip(scores, grades), start=1):
    print(f"Student {i}: Score = {score}, Grade = {grade}")

print("\n--- Passing and Failing Students ---")
print("Passing Students:", passing_students)
print("Failing Students:", failing_students)
